# Derby City Cinima Draft 

##Description
```
This is inspired by Diamond club podcast's Movie Draft league. 

##Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. class name ex( .main-info-section )
.. what class does, ex( adds padding & changes background color of .main-info-section )

2.
```

##Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. buildMovieTable();
  - Function used to itterate through my draftData and build the table out. It adds the class hidden-row to the 2nd column. That is used to hide the collumn on smaller screens. It is added back after the initial brake point via Media query.
