# Derby City Cinima Draft 

##Description

The Derby City Cinema Draft is a league of friends started back in Summer 2013. We were inspired Brian Brushwood and Diamond Club's <a href="https://draft.diamondclub.tv/">Movie Draft League</a>. Fantasy Sports for the cinephile. 

We each got  &#8362;100 to spend on a play auction. We gathered over beer and pizza and watched movie trailers. After each we would bid on it for our team. Domestic Boxoffice Gross is calculated as the score for each movie. Here you see the results of DCCD Summer Movie Draft 2018. The dream would be to turn this a full featured webapp. Create your own Leage. Set your own Movies.  


##Custom CSS Classes

The class(es) I created are:

1. 

2.


##Custom JavaScript Functions

The javascript functions I created are:

1. buildMovieTable();
  - Function used to itterate through my draftData and build the table out. It adds the class hidden-row to the 2nd column. That is used to hide the collumn on smaller screens. It is added back after the initial brake point via Media query.
